# move-dls.py
Script to move files into a folder of their last modification date.

# why?
Created to automatically move files in my windows download folder to folders with the name of the date the files were last modified. Keeps my DL folder clean.

# then what?
Nothing, I just try to go through 2 folders each day, organizing my DL's into things I need to keep, and things I need to dump
